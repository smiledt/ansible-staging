## About

> This role customizes a systems bash file by overriding /etc/bash.bashrc. At some point, I'll probably change it to override the user specific bash.bashrc file, but it's not very high to do on my todo list and quite easy to modify. 
>
> Note: This role expects the variable "standard_user" to be passed to it.
